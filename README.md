# You've reached a fork in the road...

This is a fork of James Friend's PCE.js, meant as a staging ground for changes and bug fixes made in the course of developing my [retroweb-browser](https://github.com/marciot/retroweb-browser). I eventually hope to merge these changes back into the upstream repository, so this repository should not be considered an independent fork.

If you are interested in using James' version of PCE.js, then you should look at https://github.com/jsdf/pce

If you are interested in my retroweb-browser, which adds a disk and document navigation interface to James' original work, then you should really start by looking at https://github.com/marciot/retroweb-browser
